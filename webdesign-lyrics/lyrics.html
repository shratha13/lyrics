<body>Oh, say can you see by the dawn’s early light 
<br>
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last <br> gleaming?</body>
<body>Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight, <br>
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? <br>
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air, <br>
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. <br>
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave <br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave? <br> </body>
<body>On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep, <br>
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes, <br>
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep, <br>
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? <br>
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam, <br>
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:<br>
‘Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave<br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave! <br></body>
<body>And where is that band who so vauntingly swore <br>
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion, <br>
A home and a country should leave us no more! <br>
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps’ pollution. <br>
No refuge could save the hireling and slave <br>
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:<br>
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave<br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave! <br>

Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand <br>
Between their loved home and the war’s desolation! <br>
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav’n rescued land <br>
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation. <br>
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,<br>
And this be our motto: “In God is our trust.” <br>
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
<br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!</body> <br>
