<p>I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
</p>
<p>To go over everything
</p>
<p>They say that time's supposed to heal ya
</p>
<p>But I ain't done much healing

</p>


<p>Hello, can you hear me
</p>
<p>I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
</p>
<p>When we were younger and free
</p>
<p>I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

</p>
<p>There's such a difference between us <br><br>
And a million miles</p>
<p>Hello from the other side <br><br>
I must have called a thousand times <br><br>
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done <br><br>
But when I call you never seem to be home</p> 
<p>Hello from the outside
</p>
<p>At least I can say that I've tried
</p>
<p>To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart <br><br>
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore</p>
<p>Hello, how are you? <br><br>
It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry <br><br>
I hope that you're well <br><br>
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened</p>
<p>It's no secret that the both of us <br><br>
Are running out of time</p>
<p>So hello from the other side <br><br>
I must have called a thousand times <br><br>
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done <br><br>
But when I call you never seem to be home <br><br>
Hello from the outside <br><br>
At least I can say that I've tried <br><br>
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart <br><br>
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore</p>
<p>Ooooohh, anymore <br><br>
Ooooohh, anymore <br><br>
Ooooohh, anymore <br><br>
Anymore</p>
<p>Hello from the other side <br><br>
I must have called a thousand times <br><br>
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done <br><br>
But when I call you never seem to be home <br><br>
Hello from the outside <br><br>
At least I can say that I've tried <br><br>
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart <br><br>
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore</p>
